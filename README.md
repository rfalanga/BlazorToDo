# BlazorToDo
A Microsoft Learn course on the basics of Blazor

I'm following the [Blazor ToDo List](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-blazor-webassembly-visual-studio-code/?WT.mc_id=dotnet-35129-website) Microsoft Learn tutorial.

## .NET Core version used
In the tutorial they used .NET 6. 

## What version I'll use
I'll use .NET 8

## May need to use .NET 6
I've got .NET 6 and 8 installed on my desktop. But there's some differences. First, the tutorial, when I work with it at home, allows me to chose between erither VS Code or Visual Studio. And the other thing is from within Visual Studio, I cannot create a Blazor Server App cannot be created for .NET 8. At best I can only create it for .NET 7. And when I run the command `dotnet --list-sdks` doesn't list .NET 7, in Visual Studio. At best that I create a Blazor Server App with .NET 6.
